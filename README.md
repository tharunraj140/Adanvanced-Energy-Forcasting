# Adanvanced-Energy-Forcasting
This repository contains tools, models, and datasets for advanced energy forecasting, leveraging modern machine learning and statistical methods. The focus is on predicting energy demand and generation patterns with high accuracy across different time horizons, including short-term 
(hourly/daily), medium-term (weekly/monthly), and long-term (seasonal/annual) forecasts.<br>

##Key Features.
##Data Preprocessing:
Includes scripts for cleaning and normalizing energy datasets (e.g., electricity, gas, renewable energy sources).<br>
##Feature Engineering:
Techniques for creating meaningful features from raw data, such as weather conditions, economic indicators, and historical energy consumption.<br>
##Machine Learning Models: 
##Implementation of various machine learning algorithms like:
1)RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks).<br>
2)LSTM(Long-short term Memory).<br>
###Visualization: Tools to visualize forecast results and trends for easy interpretation.
