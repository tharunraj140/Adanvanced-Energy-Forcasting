# Advanced-energy-consumption-forecasting-and-data-analysis-using-RNN-and-LSTM
## Project Overview
This project aims to predict future energy consumption using historical data and advanced machine learning techniques. Specifically, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are utilized to build robust forecasting models. The objective is to leverage these models to provide accurate energy consumption predictions, which can aid in energy management and planning.
